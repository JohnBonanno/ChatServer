This is a basic chat server the server is ran by executing the file chatRoom.java. A user connects to server by running ChatScreen localhost username on the command line. A user can type a message and hit send, to send a message to all other users that are connected to the server. A user disconnects by hitting exit. I chose this program to demonstrate an example of my work completed in a group setting. This program also demonstrates understanding in how a computer system interacts with a network by creating a server, and allowing clients to connect to it. I chose this program to include in my portfolio because I thought the portability of it is impressive - that it can be ran anywhere and be connec

 This program is a great example of concurrent programming by means of utilizing an executor thread pool. I think that using the threadpool and doing socket programming is important for most modern applications, so I thought this program would be a good way to demonstrate experience in doing so. I liked that we were allowed some creativity in that we were able to define our own network protocol and implement it. Implementing it definitely took lots of communication while working in our group, and a difficult program like this, completed as a group, likely help all of our understanding in that we were often explaining difficult concepts to one another. This program also implements the runnable interface and
